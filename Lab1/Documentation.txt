Placement of the sensors:
The sensors have been placed on all out and in paths from both the crossing and on the two 
places where the track splits into two. On the crossing a sensor is needed on every in and 
out part of track to always know when a train exits and enters the zone around the actual crossing. 
If a train already is within the zone another can not enter until the first one has exited. 
On the four places where two tracks merges into one sensors are used before the merge. 
These sensors are there to look if a train already has entered the single file zone and 
if the train should wait. There are also sensors after the merge. These are used when a 
train is going the oposite direction and is used to see if the shortest path to the station 
or the next single bit is free. If the shorterst path is under use the other path is simply taken. 
Lastly sensores are also placed at the station so that the train know when to stop and turn back. 
All the sensors are placed far back enough so that the trains have time to stop before the 
specific crossing, merge or before running of the track at the station. 

Choice of critical sections:

Maximum train speed and the reason for it:
The maximum train speed is set to 15 since no greater train speed was required in the lab instructions.

How you tested your solution:
We test our solution by running the trains for periods of time with varying speeds on the trains. 
We make sure to select different speeds for the two trains to also test that they don't catch up to 
each other and to test so that they are able to pass each other.
